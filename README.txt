Project: Genetic Algorithm
by Tyler Edwards 
Added March 2024

Description: Implement a Genetic Algorithm to idenifity the maximum of a given value and then check its effectiveness.

Language: Python

Reason: For CPSC 390 (Artificial Intelligence)

Successes: After the actual algorithm was completed, plotting it out into a 2D structure was easy

Setbacks: Code would give me the same value for every single genetation and wouldn't change at first, then the graph had every single individual on it rather than the increments of 50 that the assignment asked for

Learned: how simple it is to plot things by importing Python libraries, the inner workings of genetic algorithms
